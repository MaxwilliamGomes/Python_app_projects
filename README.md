# Tip-Calculator
The idea here is to create a shared payments calculator.  
You know that moment when we're at a table with friends and we have to pay the bill, but you only ordered a can of coke?  
That's right, this calculator will help you pay only for what you consumed with the percentage of the tip referring to what you consumed.
